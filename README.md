## 📖 Introduction

**Group Guard** is a desktop application designed for VRChat Group Owners and Moderators. It seamlessly integrates with the VRChat API and local log files to provide a real-time "God View" of your group instances.

Unlike simple mods or discord bots, Group Guard is a **standalone external tool** that runs on your PC, ensuring compliance with VRChat's Terms of Service by only reading logs and using the official API (no game memory injection).

## ✨ Key Features

- **Actions**: Automatically Notify when a rule is triggered.

### 🔞 Instance Guard

## ⚠️ Safety & Compliance

Group Guard is an **external tool**. It does **not** modify the game client, inject code, or read memory. It interacts with VRChat solely through:

1.  **VRChat API**: Standard web requests (like the website).
2.  **Log Files**: Reading text logs generated by VRChat (`output_log.txt`).
3.  **OSC**: One-way communication for chatbox messages.

_Use responsibly. Automated actions (like mass inviting) are rate-limited to avoid API spam, but you are responsible for your account's actions._
