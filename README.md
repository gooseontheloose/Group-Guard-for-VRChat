## 📖 Introduction

**Group Guard** is a desktop application designed for VRChat Group Owners and Moderators. It seamlessly integrates with the VRChat API and local log files to provide a real-time "God View" of your group instances.

Unlike simple mods or discord bots, Group Guard is a **standalone external tool** that runs on your PC, ensuring compliance with VRChat's Terms of Service by only reading logs and using the official API (no game memory injection).

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ AutoMod & Security

Automate your instance security to keep trolls and bad actors out.

- **Rule Engine**: Create custom rules based on Trust Rank, Account Age, Keywords (in Bio/Status), and more.
- **Actions**: Automatically "Block" (Kick) or "Notify" when a rule is triggered.
- **Ban Evasion Detection**: (Planned) Heuristics to flag potential ban evaders.

### 📡 Live Ops Command Center

Monitor and control your active instance in real-time.

- **Instance Monitor**: See exactly who is in your instance, their extensive details, and when they joined.
- **Scan Sector**: One-click scan to refresh player lists from logs.
- **Mass Invite**: Invite all your online friends to the current instance with smart filtering (AutoMod checks, already present checks).
- **Rally Forces**: Invite users from a previous session file—perfect for re-hosting crashed instances.

### 👥 Group Management

Direct integration with your VRChat Groups.

- **Member Management**: View, search, and manage group members.
- **Bans & Kicks**: Quickly ban or kick users from the group directly from the UI.
- **Instance Browser**: View all active instances for your groups and join them instantly.

### 💬 OSC Chatbox Integration

Enhance in-game communication without typing.

- **Announcer**: Automatically send welcome messages to new joins or periodic announcements (e.g., "Join our Discord!").
- **MagicChatBox Compatible**: Built to work alongside other OSC tools.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+)
- VRChat Account (with VRC+ for some features, though not strictly required)

### Installation (Development)

1.  **Clone the repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/group-guard.git
    cd group-guard
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run locally**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start both the Electron backend and the React frontend in hot-reload mode.

### Usage Guide

1.  **Login**: Launch the app and log in with your VRChat credentials. (Supports 2FA).
2.  **Select Group**: Choose the group you want to manage from the sidebar.
3.  **Join World**: Enter a VRChat instance. Group Guard uses your VRChat log files to detect where you are.
4.  **Configure**:
    - Go to **Settings** to point the app to your VRChat install folder (usually automatic).
    - Go to **AutoMod** to set up your protection rules.
5.  **Monitor**: Switch to the **Dashboard** to see the live feed of events and players.

## ⚠️ Safety & Compliance

Group Guard is an **external tool**. It does **not** modify the game client, inject code, or read memory. It interacts with VRChat solely through:

1.  **VRChat API**: Standard web requests (like the website).
2.  **Log Files**: Reading text logs generated by VRChat (`output_log.txt`).
3.  **OSC**: One-way communication for chatbox messages.

_Use responsibly. Automated actions (like mass inviting) are rate-limited to avoid API spam, but you are responsible for your account's actions._
