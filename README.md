## 📖 Introduction

**Group Guard** is a desktop application designed for VRChat Group Owners and Moderators. It seamlessly integrates with the VRChat API and local log files to provide a real-time "God View" of your group instances.

Unlike simple mods or discord bots, Group Guard is a **standalone external tool** that runs on your PC, ensuring compliance with VRChat's Terms of Service by only reading logs and using the official API (no game memory injection).

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ AutoMod & Security

Automate your instance security to keep trolls and bad actors out.

- **Rule Engine**: Create custom rules based on Trust Rank, Account Age, Keywords based on bio/status, and more.
- **Actions**: Automatically Notify, Warn, or Kick when a rule is triggered.
- **Staff Whitelist**: **New!** Exempt trusted friends and moderators from strict rules.
    - **User Whitelist**: Allow specific users by name.
    - **Group Whitelist**: Allow entire ranks (e.g., "Moderator") from your group to bypass checks.

### ⚡ Performance & Stability (New)

We've completely overhauled the backend to be faster, smarter, and safer.

- **2-Stage "Lightning" Loading**:
    - **Stage 1 (Instant)**: Loads cached groups immediately on startup so you can interact instantly.
    - **Stage 2 (Background)**: Verifies permissions silently in the background.
- **Tortoise Mode (Rate Limit Protection)**:
    - Smart serial queue that processes group updates one-by-one to respect VRChat's strict API limits.
    - No more 429 Too Many Requests errors during large scans.
- **Predictive Caching**:
    - Quietly fetches and caches moderation permissions for your groups while the app is idle.
    - Result: Clicking a group feels instant because the data is already there.
- **Strict Cache Isolation**:
    - **Security:** Ensures cached data from one account is *never* shown to another.
    - Automatically wipes local cache on logout or forced account switch.

### 🔞 Instance Guard

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AppleExpl01t/VRChat-Group-Guard.git
    cd VRChat-Group-Guard
    ```

    > **Developer Note**: Please refer to [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md) for detailed setup, testing, and architecture information.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run locally**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Logs

If you encounter issues, we have a new **Persistent Logging System** to help debug.

- **Log Location**: `%APPDATA%\vrchat-group-guard\logs`
    - (Type `%APPDATA%` in Windows Run dialog or File Explorer address bar).
- **Log Files**:
    - `latest.log`: The log for the *current* active session.
    - `log_YYYY-MM-DD_...txt`: Archived logs from previous sessions (automatically rotated on startup).
- **What to do**:
    - Check `latest.log` for lines starting with `[ERROR]` or `[WARN]`.
    - Provide these logs if you open a GitHub Issue.

## 🎨 Themes & Customization

Group Guard features a comprehensive theming system with real-time customization.

- **Presets**: 🌙 Dark, ☀️ Light, 🌌 Midnight, 🌅 Sunset.
- **Colors**: Full HSL control for Neons, Accents, and Backgrounds.
- **Effects**: Adjustable **Glass Blur**, **Opacity**, and **Particles** that react to your mouse.

*> Go to **Settings → Appearance** to customize.*

## ⚠️ Safety & Compliance

Group Guard is an **external tool**. It does **not** modify the game client, inject code, or read memory. It interacts with VRChat solely through:

1.  **VRChat API**: Standard web requests (like the website).
2.  **Log Files**: Reading text logs generated by VRChat (`output_log.txt`).
3.  **OSC**: One-way communication for chatbox messages.

_Use responsibly. Automated actions (like mass inviting) are rate-limited to avoid API spam, but you are responsible for your account's actions._
